Knowledge is born free and it is in chains everywhere.

We live our lives immersed in networks, communication, information, of
production and distribution, which could shorten the dista ances, limit the
effort, freeing creativity, spreading information, knowledge, sociality, art.

Instead, this opportunity turns into an omnivorous machine that penetrates
capillary in our lives, it feeds on our experiences for generate profit, suck
our intelligence and then lock the fruits under the most impenetrable bolts.

Rebellion is right, necessary and inevitable.

May the revolt come, but have bright colors and a mighty rhythmic section.


# This is our manifesto

## GNUFunk is GNU

* True knowledge is free, open, shared
* An idea, a work, a product do not increase their value, efficacy or beauty thanks to the addition of a signature or a brand
* Creation is a (more or less) individual synthesis of collective elements: its results must be shared
* Most probably there is someone out there who can improve your ideas
* Roughly everything can be opened, recombined, closed and see if it works
* And viceversa

## GNUFunk is Funk:
* What we like is the warmth of the bodies that dance to the rhythm of music: pump up the volume
* Everything comes from the needs of the people around you, everything must come back to them: give them time and respect
* There is no reason why all this cannot be done with a great deal of style

## GNUFunk is freentry / openbar
* Access to knowledge must be free, free and guaranteed for everyone
* Satisfy your thirst for knowledge and your appetites for creativity everything you see, hear, touch and consume is built on your experiences / knowledge / preferences and it is time for you to regain it
